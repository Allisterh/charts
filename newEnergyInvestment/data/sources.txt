The following images were analyzed:
- chinaBySector.png
- europeBySector.png
- usBySector.png
- worldBySector.png

Data was saved to the following files:
- chinaSolar.csv
- chinaSolarWind.csv
- chinaSolarWindOther.csv
- europeWindon.csv
- europeWindonWindoff.csv
- europeWindonWindoffSolar.csv
- europeWindonWindoffSolarOther.csv
- usWind.csv
- usWindSolar.csv
- usWindSolarOther.csv

The data in each file mark the point (in $USD Billion) of each bar
in each figure. For example, "chinaSolar.csv" marks the investment in China
in solar energy, while the "chinaSolarWind.csv" marks the investment in China
in solar + wind energy. So to get the wind energy investment, you need to
subtract the values in "chinaSolar.csv" from "chinaSolarWind.csv".
The first column in each data file are a series of "Bar" values, which mark
the year. Bar0 is 2005 and Bar13 is 2018.
