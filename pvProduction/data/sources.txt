Annual Solar Photovoltaics Cell Production by Country, 2005-2018:
Jäger-Waldau, A. (2019). Snapshot of Photovoltaics—February 2019. Energies, 12(5), 769. https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/5/769

The paper and main figure (Figure 1) are these files:
- energies-12-00769.pdf
- energies-12-00769-g001.png

Raw data was measured from Figure 1 using WebPlotDigitizer
(https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/)
and output to the following files:
- productionTotal.csv
- productionChina.csv
- productionUS1.csv
- productionUS0.csv

The "productionUS0.csv" and "productionUS1.csv" files were measurements from
the top and bottom of the bars, so the US production is the difference
between these two
